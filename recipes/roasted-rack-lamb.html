                <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>

                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>1 (7 bone) rack of lamb, trimmed and frenched</li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
            </ul>
        <em><h4>Steps</h4></em>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Move the oven rack to the center position.</li>
            <li>Combine bread crumbs, garlic, rosemary, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl; stir in 2 tablespoons olive oil to moisten the mixture. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Season rack of lamb all over with 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large heavy oven-proof skillet over high heat. Add lamb and sear on all sides, about 1 to 2 minutes: set lamb aside for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Brush lamb with mustard and roll in bread crumb mixture until evenly coated. Cover the ends of the bones with foil to prevent charring.</li>
            <li>Arrange the breaded rack of lamb bone-side down in the same skillet. Roast in preheated oven for 12 to 18 minutes for medium; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 130 degrees F (54 degrees C), or continue to cook to desired doneness.</li>
            <li>Remove lamb from the skillet and allow to rest for 5 to 7 minutes, loosely covered with foil, before carving between the ribs.</li>
